For any of these directories of sample code, you can compile the code as follows:

.. code:: bash

    write some code

    mkdir $SAMPLE_CODE_DIR/build
    cd $SAMPLE_CODE_DIR/build
    cmake ..
    make

This will generate an executable in :code:`$SAMPLE_CODE_DIR/build` which can be run to
view the output
